# BACKEND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGE
Oh no! Canvas had an outage. The university has assigned your team to create an improvised application to handle online quizzes.

Build a CRUD operation API using NodeJS and Express, using a MongoDB or MySQL Database (choose one).

**Questions**:
Each question in the quiz must have the following data:
- Question
- At least 2 choices
- Correct answer

**Routes**:
- /create -> Add a question to the database.
- /update -> Edit a question.
- /delete -> Delete a question from the database.
- /get -> Get question data.
- /list -> List all questions in the MongoDB database
- /check-answer -> Pass a choice to the question, and check if it is correct, wrong, or invalid (not in the choices).
